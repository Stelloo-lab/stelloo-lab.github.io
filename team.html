      <h3>Suzan Stelloo</h3>
      <p>
        Suzan completed a master in cancer genomics and developmental biology (CGDB) at Utrecht University.
        She then pursued a PhD at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, where she focused on chromatin biology and genomics in prostate cancer. Her work explored how androgen receptor binding patterns could be used for patient stratification. During her postdoc at Radboud University, she transitioned into proteomics and developmental biology, expanding her research from cancer to early human development. In September 2025, Suzan started her team at Radboudumc, continuing her dual focus on prostate cancer and early embryogenesis. This work is supported by ZonMw (PSIDER) and the Dutch Cancer Society (KWF Young Investigator Grant).

        <h3>Yolanda Chang</h3>
      <p>
        Yolanda is a postdoc in the lab and her research involves investigating early human development using pluripotent stem cells derived gastruloid models. Yolanda is fascinated by the questions of how cell fate decisions are made during the early embryo development, and what factors can influence these decisions. She is specifically interested in detangling the molecular mechanisms in human gastrulation using proteomics. Before joining Suzan's team, she completed her PhD at Leiden (LUMC) where she worked on the modeling of human germ cell development using human pluripotent stem cells and 3D culturing systems. Outside the lab, she enjoys going for a run or hike when the weather is nice and play board games and video games on a rainy day.

          <h3> Martijn Hendriksen</h3>
      <p>
        Martijn is Research Technician in the team contributing to the PSIDER and KWF research projects.

In 2023, he obtained his Bachelor’s degree in Life Sciences (HLO) from the HAN University of Applied Sciences. As part of his studies, he completed internships at the Princess Máxima Center for Pediatric Oncology and at UMC Utrecht. At the Princess Máxima Center, he focused on optimizing drug delivery through lipid nanoparticles, while at UMC Utrecht he contributed to the development of metabolic reporters.

Following his graduation, he joined the research group of Professor Michiel Vermeulen at Radboud University Nijmegen, where he was involved in proteomics research. His responsibilities included conducting proteomics experiments and overseeing the maintenance and quality control of the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). His experience in the field of proteomics has provided him with a solid basis, which he is enthusiastic to apply to the research projects carried out by the Stelloo Team.
