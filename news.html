            <h2>16 January 2026</h2>
            <p>On Friday the 16th of January the Stelloo team participated in the <strong>Netherlands Proteomics Platform (NPP)</strong> Annual Meeting in Utrecht.</p>
            <p>It was a nice opportunity to connect with the Dutch proteomics community and see the latest developments in MS-equipment!</p>

            <h2>12 November 2025</h2>
           <p>On 12 November, we attended the <strong>Pluripotent Stem cells for Inherited Diseases and Embryonic Research (PSIDER)</strong> kickoff meeting. The program focuses on:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Developing alternative model systems for human embryos.</li>
          <li>Generating knowledge for the prevention and treatment of serious hereditary diseases.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The meeting brought together all funded PSIDER top projects, offering an inspiring overview of innovative approaches using stem cells to model human development and hereditary diseases. Among the presentations was one by Martijn van der Meer on the <em>Journal of Trial and Error</em>, a unique journal dedicated to publishing negative and unexpected results.</p>

            <h2>November 2025</h2>
            <p>Jules and several colleagues are growing moustaches this Movember to raise awareness for men's health and prostate cancer research. Movember is a global movement that encourages growing moustaches during November to spark conversations and fund research for men's health issues.</p>

            <h2>17 October 2025</h2>
            <p>On 17 October, we participated in the <strong>Dutch Society for Stem Cell Research (DSSCR)</strong> symposium. This annual event brings together researchers from across the Netherlands to share the latest advances in stem cell biology.</p>
            <p>The program featured inspiring talks and discussions on cutting-edge technologies and applications of stem cells in health and disease. We were excited to contribute to the scientific exchange by presenting our work on <em>human somitoids</em> and <em>p300 proximity labeling</em>, highlighting how these approaches help us study early human development and chromatin-associated protein interactions.</p>
